    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>repare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, lighting burners on just one side or pushing lit coals to one side.
             Preheat to medium-high heat (375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). Lightly oil grill grates over lit side.

        </li>
        <li>Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano
            skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit.</li>
          <li>
            Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from cobs.
          </li>
         <li>Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. Make a lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano, starting at stem and being careful not to cut through to other side. Remove and discard
            seeds and membranes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture into each pepper, enclosing pepper around the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li> 
        <li>
            Serve immediately with cheese sauce; pico de gallo; and (if using) cilantro, lime wedges, and/or radishes. Garnish with chili powder.
        </li>
    </ol>
